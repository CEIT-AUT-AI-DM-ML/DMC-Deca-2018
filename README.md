# DMC-Deca-2018
This is Sharif university datamining challenge, Winter 2018


One of the most powerful tools in the world of mobile apps and services to attract users is the Notification Box. This tool allows the user to communicate with the user and can bring him into the app. But there are always potentially powerful tools; sending a notification to a user who is not interested in it.
It can be ofensive and will increase the likelihood of uninstalling the application and losing the user.


In such a situation, the intelligence in sending the notification is very important for any announcement. We should choose the users -whom we are going to send notifs to- wisely.
focusing on Identifying interested people can be used without disturbing those who do not like the content of a notification, put the efforts on recognizing the benefits of sending it to people who matter that content, and encouraging them to use the app.

In this challenge, you are asked to predict the likelihood that they will click on new notifications by helping users to click the history or not on different notifications.
